#When run the code, please set working directory, these four package will help me to reform the data

#in general data from EUROSTAT, the general form of the data is classified by Unit of measure,Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community,National accounts indicator,Geopolitical entity, 
#so we can simple use ,Geopolitical entity(in our case,FR) to remove all other country data and only keep France data.
